| 2 | Define the variance of X | ```python
variance_X = 24
``` |  |
| 3 | Calculate the standard deviation (SD) of X | ```python
standard_deviation_X = np.sqrt(variance_X)
``` |  |
| 4 | Print the standard deviation | ```python
print(f"The standard deviation of X is: {standard_deviation_X:.2f}")
``` | The standard deviation of X is: 4.90 |
